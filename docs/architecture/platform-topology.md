## Overview

Platform runs as four long-lived subsystems on Kubernetes: a Go **controller** that reconciles ConfigMap-declared resources, a TypeScript **api-server** that brokers user requests and relays agent traffic, per-agent paired **agent-runtime** + **gateway** pods that host the agent process and its egress proxy, and a React **ui** served by the api-server. The controller and api-server never talk to each other directly — they coordinate through the K8s API, using a `spec.yaml` / `status.yaml` split on each ConfigMap so that writes never contend.

## Components

### controller

A stateless Go reconciler built on client-go. It watches ConfigMaps labelled `platform.ai/type` (template, agent, schedule, fork), reconciles the StatefulSet, Service, NetworkPolicy, and per-agent Secret for each agent, runs the schedule loop, and delivers trigger files to agent pods via `exec` (see [ADR-008](../adrs/008-trigger-files.md)). The controller writes only `status.yaml` on owned ConfigMaps; it never writes `spec.yaml`. See [`packages/controller/`](../../packages/controller/).

### api-server

A TypeScript server that hosts the user-facing surface and the ACP relay. It runs two listeners ([ADR-022](../adrs/022-harness-api-server.md)):

- **Public port** — user-authenticated tRPC, REST (OAuth callbacks, health, version), and the ACP relay WebSocket. The `version` endpoint is unauthenticated and powers the CLI's compatibility-floor check ([cli.md](cli.md)).
- **Harness port** — an internal-only endpoint consumed by agent pods for trigger handoff and MCP tool calls. Not exposed outside the cluster and carries no user authentication.

The api-server proxies all ACP traffic to agent pods; clients never dial pods directly. It also wakes hibernated agents on demand before forwarding the first message of a session. Both the ACP relay and the tRPC proxy verify the caller — either a Keycloak JWT or an API key ([ADR-047](../adrs/047-api-keys-headless-auth.md)), dispatched by token prefix in the same `Authorization: Bearer` slot — and check ownership at the public port, then rewrite `Authorization` to the per-agent runtime token before forwarding. Agent-runtime never sees user identity directly. See [security-and-credentials](security-and-credentials.md) and [`packages/api-server/`](../../packages/api-server/).

The public port also accepts streamed bundled file imports per agent and proxies them to the target agent-runtime without buffering — ownership-checked and size-capped at the proxy boundary.

When a session's mode changes (chat → terminal or vice versa), the api-server closes the active terminal WebSocket for the affected session, resets the agent-runtime's ACP session state, and publishes a `platform/sessionModeChanged` notification via Redis pub/sub on the agent's inject channel. Every connected ACP client receives the notification, allowing cross-tab (and cross-client, including the CLI) mode synchronization without polling.

### agent-runtime

The per-agent pod that runs the ACP WebSocket server and spawns the underlying agent binary via the harness-script contract ([ADR-023](../adrs/023-harness-agnostic-base-image.md), [ADR-037](../adrs/037-remote-terminal.md)). Its responsibilities are:

- Accept one ACP WebSocket connection (relayed from the api-server) and speak JSON-RPC 2.0 to the agent process. Chat-mode sessions spawn `/usr/local/bin/harness-chat` as the ACP subprocess.
- Accept terminal-mode WebSocket connections on `/api/terminal` (relayed from the api-server). Each session gets a PTY running `/usr/local/bin/harness-terminal`; agent-runtime relays a binary input/output/resize frame protocol both ways and serializes scrollback so a refresh within a 30 s grace window reattaches.
- Watch a well-known trigger directory and forward scheduled triggers to the api-server's harness port.
- Expose a scoped tRPC router (via the api-server's tRPC proxy) for in-pod file operations surfaced to the UI.
- Hold an SSE connection to the api-server's pod-files endpoint and materialize declarative file state under the agent's HOME — currently `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml` for granted GitHub Enterprise app connections, more producers might come. Refuses paths outside HOME (defense-in-depth) and skips the loop when `PLATFORM_POD_FILES_EVENTS_URL` is unset (forks).
- Accept bundled file imports on the harness port — extract the tarball to a staging directory on the per-agent PVC, then `rm`+`rename` each top-level entry into `<homeDir>/work` (top-level folders are atomic units; unrelated existing top-level entries in `work/` survive). One import per agent at a time; a boot sweeper reclaims staging dirs orphaned by crashes (see [persistence](persistence.md)).

The agent-runtime pod holds zero credential Secrets and has no admitted route to TCP 80/443 except its paired gateway pod ([ADR-038](../adrs/038-paired-gateway-pod.md)). Its `HTTPS_PROXY` value is the per-agent gateway Service DNS, but the value is decorative — Kubernetes admits no other route. See [`packages/agent-runtime/`](../../packages/agent-runtime/) and [`packages/agent-runtime-api/`](../../packages/agent-runtime-api/).

### gateway

A per-agent Envoy pod paired with the agent-runtime pod ([ADR-038](../adrs/038-paired-gateway-pod.md)). Mounts the owner's credential Secrets, the cert-manager-issued leaf TLS material, and the rendered Envoy bootstrap ConfigMap. Terminates the agent's egress TLS, injects credentials on the wire, and gates each credentialed request through the api-server's ext_authz handler. NetworkPolicy admits ingress only from the paired agent pod and egress only to upstream services, the api-server's ext_authz port, and DNS. See [security-and-credentials](security-and-credentials.md).

### ui

A React + Vite single-page app served by the api-server. It uses tRPC over HTTP for resource management and permission flows, and opens one ACP WebSocket per active session for bidirectional agent communication. Permission prompts, tool calls, and streaming output all flow over the same ACP connection. See [`packages/ui/`](../../packages/ui/).

## Protocols

| Edge | Protocol | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| ui → api-server (`<rel>-apiserver`) | tRPC over HTTP | CRUD on templates, agents, schedules, sessions |
| ui → api-server | WebSocket (ACP, JSON-RPC 2.0) | Live chat session, permission prompts, streaming output; also carries `platform/sessionModeChanged` notifications for cross-client mode sync |
| ui → api-server | WebSocket (binary terminal frames) | Live terminal session — input / output / resize / exit, see [ADR-037](../adrs/037-remote-terminal.md) |
| cli → api-server | tRPC over HTTP | Session CRUD + `resolveTerminal`, agent resolution, auth (same tRPC surface the UI uses) |
| cli → api-server | WebSocket (binary terminal frames) | `dam chat` terminal attach — same frame protocol as the UI terminal path; server-provided `terminalPath` from `resolveTerminal` |
| api-server → agent-runtime | WebSocket (ACP, JSON-RPC 2.0) | Chat-mode relay target — one hop, no fan-out |
| api-server → agent-runtime | WebSocket (binary terminal frames) | Terminal-mode relay target — one hop, single client per session |
| api-server → agent-runtime | HTTP (tRPC proxy) | In-pod file operations surfaced to the UI |
| ui → api-server → agent-runtime | HTTP (multipart, streamed) | Bundled file import — single streamed roundtrip, no buffering on the relay; per-file merge into `<homeDir>/work` |
| agent-runtime → api-server (`<rel>-apiserver-harness`, via paired gateway → Istio waypoint) | HTTP | MCP tool access, pod-files SSE, `/api/agents/:id/internal/trigger` (ADR-041) |
| gateway → api-server (`<rel>-extauthz-<id>`) | gRPC | HITL ext_authz Check; per-agent Service pinned by AuthorizationPolicy to the gateway's SA principal (ADR-041) |
| controller → K8s API | watch / list / write | Resource reconciliation and status writes |
| api-server → K8s API | REST | Resource CRUD, spec writes, pod wake |
| controller → agent-runtime | K8s `exec` | Atomic trigger-file delivery |

ACP frames are JSON-RPC 2.0, one logical message per WebSocket frame.

## K8s resource model

Platform models all of its domain state as ConfigMaps labelled `platform.ai/type` ([ADR-006](../adrs/006-configmaps-over-crds.md)). Each ConfigMap carries two keys:

- `spec.yaml` — user intent. Owned exclusively by the api-server.
- `status.yaml` — observed state and scheduler bookkeeping. Owned exclusively by the controller.

| `platform.ai/type` | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `agent-template` | Template: image, command, default env, injection rules |
| `agent` | Agent: image, command, env, skills, secret refs, allowed users, `desiredState`. Carries **both** `spec.yaml` (api-server) and `status.yaml` (controller) per [ADR-046](../adrs/046-eliminate-instance.md) |
| `agent-schedule` | Schedule: cron or RRULE, quiet hours, task payload, session mode |
| `agent-fork` | Forked run: parent agent ref + overrides |

For each `agent`, the controller reconciles **two paired StatefulSets** (agent + gateway, both at replicas 0 when hibernated and 1 when running), **two pair-scoped Services** (agent's ACP and the gateway's `<agent>-gateway` proxy DNS), a **per-agent ServiceAccount** (in the agent ns), a **per-agent ext-authz Service** (`<release>-extauthz-<id>`, in the release ns), **three per-agent Istio AuthorizationPolicies** (gateway admission, harness path-prefix at the waypoint, ext-authz Service principal), and a per-agent Envoy bootstrap ConfigMap + leaf-TLS Certificate ([ADR-033](../adrs/033-envoy-credential-gateway.md), [ADR-038](../adrs/038-paired-gateway-pod.md), [ADR-041](../adrs/041-istio-ambient-mesh.md)). ConfigMaps are chosen over CRDs for the domain types so Platform installs without cluster-admin; the controller does need write access to ServiceAccounts and Istio AuthorizationPolicies. See [`deploy/helm/platform/templates/`](../../deploy/helm/platform/templates/) for the install layout.

## Invariants

- **Spec/status ownership.** Controller never writes `spec.yaml`; api-server never writes `status.yaml`. Write contention between the two is impossible by convention.
- **Relay-only ACP.** All ACP traffic is proxied through the api-server. Agent pods do not accept ACP connections from outside the cluster and the UI never dials pods directly.
- **Two-port api-server.** The public port is user-authenticated; the harness port is cluster-internal and has no user authentication. They do not share routes.
- **Credential isolation.** Agent pods never hold real upstream credentials. The paired gateway pod intercepts agent TLS using a per-agent leaf cert and injects the credential header from a K8s Secret mounted only on the gateway — the agent pod has no path to TCP 80/443 except through the paired gateway ([ADR-033](../adrs/033-envoy-credential-gateway.md), [ADR-038](../adrs/038-paired-gateway-pod.md)). See [security-and-credentials](security-and-credentials.md).
- **SPIFFE identity per hop.** Three mesh hops, each gated by a per-agent Istio AuthorizationPolicy: (1) agent → gateway on the CONNECT proxy port, (2) gateway → harness via the waypoint (all agent egress traverses the paired gateway pod's Envoy, including the harness call), (3) gateway → ext-authz on the per-agent ext-authz Service. The waypoint-fronted harness Service enforces principal == URL `:id`; per-agent ext-authz Services enforce principal == matching SA ([ADR-041](../adrs/041-istio-ambient-mesh.md)). For long-lived pairs both pods share the per-agent SA, so the gateway hop is identity-equivalent to the agent. No app-layer header conveys identity.
- **Atomic triggers.** Trigger files are delivered via write-temp + rename so the agent's trigger watcher never reads a partial file.
