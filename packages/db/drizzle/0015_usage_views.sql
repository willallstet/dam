-- "is this sub core?" is sourced from the actor_roles table, upserted by the
-- persist-activity saga on every UserAuthenticated event from JWT
-- realm_access.roles. Agent ownership is resolved via the `agents` table,
-- populated by the persist-agents saga on `AgentCreated`/`AgentDeleted` plus
-- a startup bootstrap that backfills agents pre-dating the saga.
