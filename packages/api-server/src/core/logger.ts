/** The api-server's structured logger.
 *
 *  Backed by Pino — a single process-wide instance configured once at startup
 *  (index.ts), imported via `getLogger()` so it need not be threaded through
 *  every service factory (the same singleton shape as `emit()`/`events$()` in
 *  `events.ts`). Pino emits one JSON object per line on STDOUT; visibility is
 *  governed by the configured level (the common `error|warn|info|debug`),
 *  with no bespoke per-feature toggles. It is the substrate the security audit
 *  trail (`security-log.ts`) is built on, but it is a general logger — any
 *  component may use it.
 *
 *  In Kubernetes stdout and stderr are merged into one pod log, so consumers
 *  discriminate on fields (the audit trail's `category`), not on stream. */
